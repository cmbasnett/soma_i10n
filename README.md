# soma_localization
Tooling for making text localizations for [SOMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soma_(video_game)) by [Frictional Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frictional_Games) that I banged out in an afternoon.

This was started because I thought (in error) that there were no Japanese localizations for SOMA, so I started making a tool to import/export to-and-from the .lang files to a more portable format (.po), and also made tooling to generate bitmap fonts to support all the characters used in the translation.

I'm not writing any proper documentation because I don't intend to revisit this, but if you stumble upon this and want to make a localization for SOMA into another language, you can use this as a starting point.
